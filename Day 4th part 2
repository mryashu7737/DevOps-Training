üöÄ Day 4: Project on Docker & Networking üåê

we started the discussion on the Networking which we will be using in the upcoming time with docker and shell script
revise basic concepts like Ipv4, Ipv6 hardwares devices and all.
we get to know for stablish the network we must meet some conditions
1. physical Hardware
2. Operating System in Up state.
3. Nic/Ether/LAN 
4. IP address
5. Network
6. Same type of IP such as (private- private)/ (public-public)
7. private ip ----Net------public ip
8. Routing Table 
9. connect the divices when both device's ip has same Network name then with switch otherwise with the router.

more detail discussion on the Network name and NETMASK
then we practice on the routing table such as remove the ip of any device (0.0.0.0) and then add our specific ip address to access with our gateway
same concept hands on practice with docker container os and clear the concepts of networking.
Tested privileged mode to give containers extended capabilities: docker run -it --privileged Ubuntu:14.04
